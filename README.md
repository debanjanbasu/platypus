# Prerequisites
First install the Xcode, Visual Studio Tools, etc. Beyond ths scope of explanation. This repo isn't for the faint of the heart, as it's a complex project that requires a very good understanding of Swift, Rust, Windosw, wasm, web-sys, etc.

# Install swift-bridge-cli
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge.git swift-bridge-cli
```
# Create a generic swift-library when needed
This is to create a generic swift-library when needed, and remove the git svn that's generated by the swift package init command.
```bash
mkdir -p swift-library && cd swift-library
swift package init --name swift-library --type library --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing
rm -rf .git*
```

# build.rs
Most of the items are taken care by the build.rs. However, one important file that needs to be taken care of is bridging-header.h. This file is used to bridge the Swift and Rust code together.
