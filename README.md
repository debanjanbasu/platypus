# Prerequisites
First install the Xcode, Visual Studio Tools, etc. Beyond ths scope of explanation. This repo isn't for the faint of the heart, as it's a complex project that requires a very good understanding of Swift, Rust, Windosw, wasm, web-sys, etc.

# Package Description
This library provides a unified interface to access native functionalities across all Apple, Android, Windows, and Linux targets. It leverages Rust workspaces to encapsulate platform-specific implementations. It's bridged with Swift for a seamless developer experience for all Apple targets.

Below is a table outlining the current workspaces/crates and the work being done to support them:

| Crate | macOS (v10.15+) | iOS (v13+) | watchOS (v7+) | macCatalyst (v13+) | visionOS (v1+) | Android | Windows | Linux |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|---------|---------|-------|
| biometrics    | ✅              | ✅         | ✅            | ✅                 | ✅             | ⏳      | ⏳      | ⏳    |

This structure allows for modular development and clear separation of concerns based on the underlying native APIs being accessed.

# Contributing
## Create a generic swift-library when needed inside your package
This is to create a generic swift-library when needed, and remove the git svn that's generated by the swift package init command.
```bash
mkdir -p swift-library && cd swift-library
swift package init --name swift-library --type library --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing
rm -rf .git*
```

# build.rs
Most of the items are taken care by the build.rs. However, one important file that needs to be taken care of is bridging-header.h. This file is used to bridge the Swift and Rust code together. For the time being, just copy-paste it to the root of swift-library.
